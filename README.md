# Report on Literature Review: Digitizing Conveyor Belt Systems


Prepared by: Negin Rahnamaei, Master's Student in Informatik

Dear Professor Leiding,

I am writing to provide you with a report on the literature review I conducted on digitizing conveyor belt systems as part of my master's studies in informatics. My name is Negin Rahnamaei, and I have undertaken this review to delve into the various aspects of conveyor belt technology and its digital enhancements.

The literature review aimed to explore existing research, studies, and projects related to the digitization of conveyor belts. Throughout this process, I meticulously analyzed the development, design advancements, classifications, and maintenance challenges associated with conveyor belt systems across different industrial sectors.

Beginning with a historical analysis, I traced the evolution of conveyor technology, highlighting its significance in augmenting operational efficiency and production. Subsequently, I delved into contemporary advancements such as multi-step cam mechanisms, hydro-viscous soft start devices, and magnetorheological soft starters, emphasizing their roles in reducing maintenance expenses, enhancing safety measures, and optimizing operational effectiveness.

Moreover, I explored various categories of conveyor belts and their respective uses, ranging from gravity and slat conveyors to roller and chain conveyors. Additionally, I addressed challenges such as material adhesion and deterioration, proposing novel maintenance solutions to preserve the durability and reliability of conveyor belts.

Overall, this literature review underscores the critical role of conveyor belt systems in modern industrial processes and emphasizes the importance of digitization in enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness. By synthesizing historical knowledge with contemporary advancements, I aimed to provide valuable insights into optimizing conveyor belt operations.

Thank you for the opportunity to undertake this research, and I look forward to any feedback or further guidance you may have regarding this review.

Sincerely,
Negin Rahnamaei
